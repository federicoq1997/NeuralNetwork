### Overview
This free tutorial is intended for anyone curious about building their own A.I. projects. In this tutorial, you will build a neural network from scratch and train it to make Lemonade sales predictions using a simple, synthetic dataset.   You will be introduced to PyTorch, a deep learning library managed by Meta's AI group, powering lots of A.I. applications around the world today. 

### Dataset – A Simple Lemonade Sales Synthetic Dataset
We will be working on a synthetic dataset that catalogs the daily number of lemonades sold at a lemon stand. After training, your neural network will be able to predict the number of lemonades sold on any given day.

### How to Get Started
You can find the full tutorial and follow along coding the notebook here:  (it’s free)

### Option 1 – Use Google Colab (Simplest Way)
In order to complete this assignment:
1.	Copy the following link: https://github.com/LeakyAI/FirstNeuralNet
2.	Head over to Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/
3.	Click on GitHub and paste in the repo link from (1) above
4.	Click the magnify icon on the right side of the link you pasted above
5.	Click on the FirstNeuralNetwork - Start Here.ipynb notebook and the notebook will open
6.	Follow along the tutorial to complete the notebook

### Option 2 – Run Notebook Directly on your Own Machine
If you want to use your own laptop or desktop to run the notebook locally, we recommend you complete the tutorial on How to Configure your PC for A.I. first which you can find here:
