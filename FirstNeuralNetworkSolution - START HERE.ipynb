    "### Overview\n",
    "This free tutorial is intended for anyone curious about building their own A.I. projects. In this tutorial, you will build a neural network from scratch and train it to make Lemonade sales predictions using a simple, synthetic dataset.   You will be introduced to PyTorch, a deep learning library managed by Meta's AI group, powering lots of A.I. applications around the world today. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset – A Simple Lemonade Sales Synthetic Dataset\n",
    "We will be working on a synthetic dataset that catalogs the daily number of lemonades sold at a lemon stand. After training, your neural network will be able to predict the number of lemonades sold on any given day.\n",
